# App description:
My Reads is a React Project that allows the user to manage their list of books in different categories while being able to add new books via search, remove books, or move books to other lists.

# Starting the Project:

1. Open the directory using the terminal <br />
2. run "npm install" <br />
3. run "npm start" <br />

# How to use App:
- In the bookshelves page, there are three categories of books: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". To move a book to another category or remove it from the page, open the book's edit menu (by clicking on the arrow icon at the bottom-right corner of the book) and choose the next target list or choose "None" to remove.

- Access "Add Book" page by clicking the plus icon at the bottom right corner of the main page. Use the search bar to look for a book by title. To add a book from the results to one of the bookshelves, use the similar edit menu of the book. If a book is currently in a list and appears as a search result, its current list will be highlighted in the edit menu. Changing a book's list or removing it can be done in the same manner as in the main page. To return to the main page, click the arrow at the left of the search bar.
